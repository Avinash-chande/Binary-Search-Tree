# 🧠 Binary Search Tree (BST)

This repository contains implementations of **Binary Tree** and **Binary Search Tree (BST)** operations in **C++**.  
It includes basic and advanced functionalities like **creation**, **insertion**, **deletion**, and **traversal** — both **recursive** and **non-recursive** versions.

  - Postorder (Left → Right → Root)
  - Level Order (Breadth-First Traversal)
